## System Overview

BlockFeedback is designed to enhance customer engagement by providing a simple, blockchain-based feedback collection system. Customers submit feedback through an easy-to-use interface, and the data is cryptographically signed to ensure its authenticity.

```

### Key Components

1. **User Interface**: Built with Next.js, the interface allows customers to easily connect their wallets via ConnectKit and submit feedback. The design prioritizes simplicity and ease of use.
2. **Wallet Connection**: **ConnectKit** provides secure and easy wallet connection functionality.
3. **Feedback Submission**: Once feedback is submitted, it is cryptographically signed using **Sign Protocol**, ensuring that the data cannot be tampered with.
4. **LLM-powered Feedback Generation**: Feedback is generated using LLM models (Ollama locally, Groq in the cloud) to provide additional features for content creation.
5. **Blockchain Storage**: Feedback data is securely stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

### Summary

BlockFeedback utilizes blockchain technology to provide a secure, reliable feedback collection system. The integration of **Sign Protocol** ensures the authenticity of feedback data, while **ConnectKit** makes it easy for users to connect their wallets. The use of LLM models enhances the feedback generation process.

## Features

- **Real-Time Feedback Collection**: Customers can provide feedback instantly after connecting their wallets through the interface.
- **LLM-Powered Feedback Generation**: Feedback is generated using Ollama for local environments and Groq for cloud environments.
- **Secure Data Storage**: Feedback is stored on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity and transparency.
- **Easy Wallet Authentication**: Users can securely and quickly connect their wallets using **ConnectKit**.
- **Feedback Authenticity**: All feedback is cryptographically signed using **Sign Protocol**, ensuring tamper-proof data.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Foundry for smart contract development
- A Web3-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask)
- Next.js installed

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/susumutomita/ETHOnline2024.git
   cd ETHOnline2024
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

   There are different environment variables for using **Ollama** in a local environment and **Groq** in a cloud environment. Switch between environments using the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT` variable.

   - Local environment (using LLama 3.1):

   ```plaintext
   ollama + llama3.1 setup required.
   ```

   - Cloud environment (using Groq):

   ```plaintext
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=production
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   make start
   ```

   The app will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Used for building the frontend interface.
- **Foundry**: Used for developing and deploying smart contracts.
- **ConnectKit**: Used for Web3 wallet authentication.
- **Sign Protocol**: Ensures feedback is cryptographically signed for data authenticity and integrity.
- **LLama 3.1**: Used for LLM-powered feedback generation in local environments.
- **Groq**: Used for LLM-powered feedback generation in cloud environments.

## Future Roadmap

1. **QR Code Scanning Feature**: Add a feature where users can scan a QR code to easily submit feedback.
2. **Token Distribution Feature**: Implement a feature that automatically issues tokens or coupons as rewards for feedback submission.
3. **Expand to More Retail Chains**: Broaden BlockFeedbackâ€™s deployment to additional retail partners.
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Add features to gain deeper insights into customer feedback.
5. **Mobile App Development**: Develop native mobile applications for a seamless user experience.
6. **Scalability Improvements**: Optimize the platform to handle larger volumes of feedback.
